                                    the backend portion of the application and Angular as the client for the API.

                                    For an university project i wrote a 3D Object Viewer program, integrated with WPF and using OpenGL as the rendering API.
                                    The program featured an .obj loader which allowed for the user to load several objects at once which could be viewed  in 3D and had different lighting modes for demostrative purposes.

                                    Before the WPF program i had a simple C++ console application which loaded mesh data and could render objects on the screen again using OpenGL.
                                    So i have some experience with C++ as well altough limited and with an outdated version of the language.

                                    3D rendering APIs such as OpenGL and DirectX present an interest to me and i try to work more on them in my spare time.
